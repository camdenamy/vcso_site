    <h1>Field Training</h1>
    <p>After successfully completing the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office Academy, new deputies enter an intensive Field Training Program (FTP) designed to bridge the gap between academy learning and real-world policing. 
        This program is a critical stage in a deputy's development, providing hands-on experience under the guidance of experienced Field Training Deputies (FTDs). 
        The Field Training Program emphasizes practical application of the knowledge, skills, and values acquired during the academy, preparing deputies to perform their duties confidently and competently in the field.
    </p>
    <p>Even after completing the FTP, deputies continue to receive support from their FTDs and senior deputies. Mentorship, periodic training updates, and access to resources ensure that deputies remain well-prepared, informed, and connected as they continue their journey in public service. 
        This ongoing support reflects the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office’s commitment to fostering excellence and continuous learning within its ranks.
        The Field Training Program is an essential component of a deputy’s career, transforming the foundational skills learned in the academy into effective field performance, and ensuring that each deputy is fully equipped to protect and serve the residents of Ventura County.

  <section id="patrol" class="content-section bg-light">
    <h1>On Patrol</h1>
    <p>
        Once deputies successfully complete the Field Training Program (FTP), they are assigned to Patrol, where they begin their independent duties as sworn law enforcement officers. 
        This is a pivotal step in their career, as it provides the opportunity to apply their skills in real-world situations while serving the community. 
        After gaining experience in Patrol, deputies are eligible to apply for various specialized units within the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office, such as Investigations, K9, Tactical Response Team, and Search & Rescue, 
        allowing them to expand their expertise and explore diverse career paths within the department.
